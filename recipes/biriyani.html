      In this post I show you how to make an aromatic, delicious and the best
      Chicken Biryani, not in one but 2 ways – Homestyle and restaurant style.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in yogurt and
        vinegar. Add onion; cook and stir until golden and tender. Add tomatoes,
        chile peppers, garlic, and ginger paste. Cook and stir until tomatoes
        are tender. Season with garam masala, mint, salt, and pepper. Stir in
        cilantro.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken into tomato-onion mixture in the skillet. Reduce heat to
        medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until
        chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about
        45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into meat should read
        at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
